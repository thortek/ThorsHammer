This repo is used for an assignment in my DGM 3790 Class. The assignment is to demonstrate my Git/Github skills.

Create personal Github/Bitbucket repo
===========
You need to create a personal GitHub or BitBucket repository.  This is where you will demonstrate some of your newly acquired coding skills with AngularJS, Git, JSON, etc.  

Here is what you need to do:

1. Create the repo on either service (Github/Bitbucket) with you as the owner.
2. Commit a ReadMe.md file on the Master branch of your repo
3. Create a branch off of Master named "tutorial" and commit/push the code from step-2 of the AngularJS tutorial to your branch.
4. Modify your "tutorial" branch code so that the 3 phones listed in your controllers.js file are more current phones like an iPhone 6 or Galaxy S5 (or make it even more interesting and list a bunch of funny, random items with name and snippet properties)
5. Modify your unit tests so that your tests will pass.
6.Submit the URL to your repo once you are done for grading.

*5 points* for each of the items listed above for a total of 25 points possible.
